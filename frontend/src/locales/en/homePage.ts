                comment : "Ludivine is incredibly nice and very easy to communicate with. Her professionalism is admirable, and she is always kind to her students, showing great patience as we navigate the challenges of learning a new language. She adapts her teaching methods to every person’s character, ensuring that every student can grasp the material at their own pace. Moreover, she creates a supportive atmosphere where students feel comfortable making mistakes and asking questions. She also provides constructive feedback that helps us improve our skills. Additionally, she has a very nice accent that makes learning even more enjoyable. I highly recommend her classes to anyone who wishes to learn French in a friendly and supportive environment."

            comment : "As an introvert, and also having grown up in a French family but never actually being taught the language, I’ve always been extremely afraid to speak French - too worried about making mistakes or sounding stupid. Since starting lessons with Ludivine, I've definitely noticed this has been changing. She’s incredibly patient, attentive, and creates a space where I never feel self-conscious. In just a few months, I’ve spoken more French than I have in my entire life, and I’m finally building real confidence thanks to her classes. I can’t recommend her enough.",

Im learning to speak French as a complete beginner, she is the most patient person alive. She puts up with my terrible accent and grammar and gently corrects me. She has a knack of getting the French to just flow. She speaks slowly and clearly. Shes amazing . merci Ludevine tu es tres gentille et tu es un excellent professeur."

        questions: [
            { question: "Who are you?", answer: "My name is Ludivine and I am French. I hold a master's degree in FLE, and I lived in Japan for several years where I taught French. I have a master's degree in didactics and a proficiency in Japanese. I have taught in France to very diverse audiences, mainly in French, but also in English, and I have also taught Japanese to beginners." },
            { question: "Who are your courses for?", answer: "The courses are intended for French learners from the age of 10. Whether you live in France or abroad, whether you are a complete beginner or advanced, you are welcome!" },
            { question: "Can I choose the topics of the courses?", answer: "The courses are 'à la carte', meaning they are completely tailored to your needs. Together, we will decide not only on the method but also on the topics to be covered." },
            { question: "What is the recommended frequency for the courses?", answer: "It depends on your goals. For practicing French, one session per week is quite reasonable. However, if you are preparing for an exam or want to take intensive courses, it is recommended to have 2 to 3 sessions per week to focus as much as possible on the language." },
            { question: "What do I need to take a course?", answer: "You need a good connection. You can take the course on a computer, tablet, or phone (a computer is recommended for better visibility). You do not need to download any software or application; you can connect directly to the video tool!" },
            { question: "What happens if I am late?", answer: "If you are late, the time is lost, and you will not be able to make up for it. The course will end at the scheduled time. For more information, please read the terms of sale." },
            { question: "Can I cancel or reschedule a course?", answer: "You can reschedule or cancel a course up to 24 hours before the course. If you want to cancel or reschedule within 24 hours before the course, the course will be considered due and will not be refunded. For more information, please read the terms of sale."}
